# 🎵 Spotify Clone

A **beautifully designed** Spotify-like music app, built with **React Native**. This project is mainly focused on replicating **Spotify's UI and design** while ensuring smooth user experience and responsiveness.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Start the Metro Server

Metro is the JavaScript _bundler_ that comes with React Native. It compiles and serves your app during development.

Run the following command in the **root** of your project:


# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start


### Step 2: Launch the App

Once Metro Bundler is running, open a **new terminal** in your project root and execute one of the following commands:

#### 🎯 For Android

# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android


#### 🍏 For iOS

# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios


If everything is correctly set up, your app should launch in the **Android Emulator** or **iOS Simulator**. You can also run it directly via **Android Studio** or **Xcode**.
